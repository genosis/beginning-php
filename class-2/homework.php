// #1
// write a function that calculates and returns the number of alphanumeric

// #5
// write a function that takes 2 arguments: the first is an array of strings and
// the second is a single string. The function should return the number of times the 
// single string appears within the array of strings

// #6 -- Super Bonus
// Using the function from #5, write a function that outputs some statistics about
// our array of sample strings.  For each word that appears in the array, print out
